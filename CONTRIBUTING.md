Hi there! Thank you for visiting Lagiote Revise. It's awesome to have people like you taking your valuable time and contributing!

First of all, to contribute, you'll need to fork Lagiote Revise. You can do this by clicking on the 'Fork' Button on the screen.

You should choose a repository name, and click 'Create Fork'. You have now successfully forked the program!




Next, you'll have to clone the program. There are more detailed instructions in [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository](url) but I will provide a basic overview of what you'll need to do.

You'll first need to go to the main page of the repository and click 'Code'. Then, you copy down the HTTPS url, and in the terminal paste down the link with a 'git clone' command.
Now that you've done that, you should set up syncing and create a new branch. Once you've done that, you're all set! Happy coding!
